### What is this?

At *Joltem* ( short for “jolt them” ) our goal is to create a place that allows programmers to spontaneously come together and work on the best startup ideas. 

We provide a platform that allows you to openly solicit collaboration on a for-profit side project. The project seeks to be a solution to [the broken startup process](http://joltem.tumblr.com/post/76435540928/the-broken-startup-process).

<a name="idea" class="anchor-fix"></a>
#### Want to collaborate on an idea?

To begin collaborating with others simply [post your project][1] then invite others to join you.

You can either collaborate openly with your project visible to the public or you can collaborate in a private environment based on invitations.

If you are working openly, feel free to post an announcement about your project on our [subreddit][2].

<a name="impact" class="anchor-fix"></a>
#### What is impact?

To track each user's continuous contribution to a project we use a metric called **impact**. 

Overtime accumulated **impact** will be [exchanged for equity][3] in the company. The value of impact is backed by the work of the contributors and is determined through the [review and bargain process][4].

<a name="exchange" class="anchor-fix"></a>
#### How is impact exchanged for equity?

Impact will always be backed by a pool of company stock, like an employee pool in regular companies. As work is completed on the project, users will accumulate impact through the review process. The impact the user accumulates is treated as the contribution he or she has made to creating the company. The **total impact**, a sum of all the impacts accumulated by all the users on the project, can be viewed as the total contribution to get the project to that particular state.

Periodically users will be able to exchange a portion of their impact for equity in the company, this is analogous to a vesting plan. The **exchange rate** is determined by dividing the size of the remaining backing stock pool by the total non-exchanged impact at the time of the exchange event. 

The periodicity of the exchange events rewards people who accumulated the most impact earliest in the project’s development by allowing them to exchange at higher rates. 

At any point the company’s board, which is initially just the founders, can decide to exchange the remaining backing pool at the current exchange rate or to allocate more stock for the backing pool. If the board decides on any action that may lower the value of the backing pool, such as a financing round or allocating stock to hire regular employees, they must file a proposition with the project participants and have them approve it.


<a name="review" class="anchor-fix"></a>
#### How does the review and bargain process work?

The review & bargain process is used for determine the value of each contribution. It is also meant to be a mechanism to promptly surface and resolve internal conflicts. 

After a contributor completes a solution they determine a fair evaluation for their contribution and submit it along with their solution for review.

The other contributors determine whether the solution is satisfactory and whether the evaluation for the work is fair. If the evaluation is determined to be unreasonable by the other contributors, a bargaining process follows to determine the value of the contribution.

As long as people want to keep working with each other, the bargaining process should allow them to resolve any compensation and quality control issues.

<a name="task-solutions" class="anchor-fix"></a>
#### What are tasks and solutions?

A **task** is a description of work, while a **solution** represents work or an intent to execute some work.

Tasks are proposed and curated through a process similar to [Python’s PEP system][5], once approved solutions are solicited publicly using an open allocation model.

Each task may receive multiple solutions by anyone who is willing to contribute. Each solution may contain its own set of tasks, allowing for recursive delegation of work.

Each solutions is designated a branch name in each repository of the project and only the initiator of the solution has push access to that particular branch. This allows everyone to work on a single repository, unlike the popular fork & pull model.

On completion of a solution, a peer review is initiated to evaluate the completed work. An administrator or the initiator of the parent task has the responsibility of merging in the work.

<a name="ratio" class="anchor-fix"></a>
#### What is the votes ratio?

The **votes ratio** is meant to couple reviewing with earning of impact. 

Roughly speaking it is a simple ratio of the *number of votes you have cast on other people’s solutions* over the *number you have received on your solutions* in the project with a few caps and modifications. For more detailed description of the rational behind this look at the [Voter Rational][6] task and the [current live solution][7].

If your votes ratio drops below a certain threshold you are still able to earn impact, however it will be withheld until the votes ratio is raised back up again.

<a name="company" class="anchor-fix"></a>
#### How is Joltem structured?

The *Joltem* project itself is a proof of concept, an open company. 

The company will be structured with *85%* of company's equity backing impact, the other *15%* is reserved for [Emil Davtyan][8] the founder and angel investor of the company.

Annually on the anniversary of the public release of the site *25%* of non-exchanged impact will be available to exchange for equity.


<a name="involved" class="anchor-fix"></a>
#### How to get involved?

You can follow our work without signing up, but if you want to contribute code or comment you will need to sign up.

To contribute code :

1. Sign up.
2. Add a SSH key in *Account \> Keys*, so you can clone the repository.
3. Clone the repository.
4. Read the `README.md` document, on how to setup the code for local development ( we use [Vagrant][9] ).
5. Post a solution to one of the open tasks.
6. Rinse and repeat.

If you experience a problem contact the development team at [dev@joltem.com][10] and someone will respond promptly.
