<a name="what" class="anchor-fix"></a>
### What is this?

Let us first start out by defining the problem we are looking to solve : 

*How can a workforce scale into the millions?*

The internet has scaled by orders of magnitude many of our interactions. In rare instances, it has shown us glimpses of what is possible if we work together. 

However as it currently stands starting a company is a lonesome arduous process fueled by oudated fears and processes. Traditions of closed development are boxing in innovators, locking up talent, and creating unnecessary risk for both founders and investors.

We believe the companies of tomorrow will attain workforces with millions of people nearly instantaneously and ambitious ideas will be pursued with unimaginable ease. 

What we propose here is the development of *an open incubator* to make this real by first focusing on the people most capable of accepting the idea - programmers.

We are currently in the *alpha* stage of the development process and we are openly seeking colloborators to help us build the company.

<a name="task-solutions" class="anchor-fix"></a>
#### What are tasks and solutions?

A **task** is a description of work, while a **solution** represents work or an intent to execute some work.

Tasks are proposed and curated through a process similar to [Python’s PEP system](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Python_Enhancement_Proposal#Development), once approved solutions are solicited publicly using an open allocation model.

Each task may receive multiple solutions by anyone who is willing to contribute. Each solution may contain its own set of tasks, allowing for recursive delegation of work.

Each solutions is designated a branch name in each repository of the project and only the initiator of the solution has push access to that particular branch. 

As solutions are completed, the initiator of the parent task has the responsibility of merging in the work into the branch that initiated the task. This is similar to concepts in parallel computing where tasks are performed by individual components then later reduced into a cohesive solution.

On completion of a solution, a peer review is initiated to evaluate the completed work.

<a name="impact" class="anchor-fix"></a>
#### What is impact?

To track each user's continuous contribution to a project we use a metric called **impact**. Impact is earned through the peer review of comments and solutions.

<a name="peer-review" class="anchor-fix"></a>
#### How does the peer review work?

The voting system uses a logarithmic scale and weighs votes by the voter's impact. When voting your decision will be to determine whether you find the work acceptable and if so the value of the contribution.

A vote of 0 represents unacceptable work, any vote above 0 is regarded as acceptable. If impact weighted acceptability is below 75% the user won't be awarded impact for the solution unless things are corrected.

If you find the work is acceptable you should decide whether the work is a 10, 100, 10^3, … or 10^6 on your own evaluation scale. Votes above 10 require sufficient justification from other votes to count, otherwise they will default to a lower level.

The peer review system is crucial to the health of the system, so it is important we get feedback and debate tweaks and alternatives. If you have a suggestion leave a comment on the [current live solution](http://joltem.com/joltem/solution/1/) or create your own solution on the [Determining Impact task](http://joltem.com/joltem/task/6/).

<a name="exchange" class="anchor-fix"></a>
#### How is impact exchanged for equity?

Impact will always be backed by a pool of company stock, like an employee pool in regular companies. As work is completed on the project, users will accumulate impact through the review process. The impact the user accumulates is treated as the contribution he or she has made to creating the company. The **total impact**, a sum of all the impacts accumulated by all the users on the project, can be viewed as the total contribution to get the project to that particular state.

Periodically users will be able to exchange a portion of their impact for equity in the company, this is analogous to a vesting plan. The **exchange rate** is determined by dividing the size of the remaining backing stock pool by the total non-exchanged impact at the time of the exchange event. 

The periodicity of the exchange events rewards people who accumulated the most impact earliest in the project’s development by allowing them to exchange at higher rates. 

At any point the company’s board, which is initially just the founders, can decide to exchange the remaining backing pool at the current exchange rate or to allocate more stock for the backing pool. If the board decides on any action that may lower the value of the backing pool, such as a financing round or allocating stock to hire regular employees, they must file a proposition with the project participants and have them approve it.

<a name="idea" class="anchor-fix"></a>
#### Have an idea?

This will be a place where anybody will be able to draft out ideas, get feedback, and when ready openly solicit collaboration.

However, in the *alpha* stage the only project available is the *Joltem* project itself.

<a name="company" class="anchor-fix"></a>
#### How is the company structured?

The *Joltem* project itself is a proof of concept, an open company. 

The company will be structured with *85%* of company's equity backing impact, the other *15%* is reserved for [Emil Davtyan](http://joltem.com/user/emil/) the founder and angel investor of the company.

Annually on the anniversary of the public release of the site *25%* of non-exchanged impact will be available to exchange for equity.


<a name="involved" class="anchor-fix"></a>
#### How to get involved?

You can follow our work without signing up, but if you want to contribute code or comment you will need to sign up.

To contribute code :

1. Sign up.
2. Add a SSH key in *Account > Keys*, so you can clone the repository.
3. Clone the repository.
4. Read the `README.md` document, on how to setup the code for local development ( we use [Vagrant](http://www.vagrantup.com) ).
5. Post a solution to one of the open tasks.
6. Rinse and repeat.

If you experience a problem contact the development team at <dev@joltem.com> and someone will respond promptly.
